<h1> Smart Brain front end! </h1>
<br>
<p>This front end was built using React.js. Once a user has registered and logged in, they can submit an image URL to Smart Brain, which will then detect a face within an image. Try it out!</p>
<br>
<p>This was my first application built with React, and I am excited to continue to build on these skills as I expand my React knowledge.</p>
